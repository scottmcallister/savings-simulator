# savings-simulator

This project was built using spring boot and react. The back end doesn't really do much right now besides just serve up the react front end. 

## Running Locally

Open a terminal and watch for changes in webpack. 

```
npm run watch
```

Open a second terminal and run the spring server

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
